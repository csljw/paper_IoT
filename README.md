This is the our code of our paper in IEEE IoT. 
model.py is the used basic ESN.
SD.py includes the implementation of Algorithm 1 in this paper.
proposed_method.py includes the implementation of Algorithm 2 and 3 in this paper.
If you want to run your own dataset, you should encode your own config.py and dataloader.py.
